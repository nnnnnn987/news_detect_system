# news_detect_system
The main roles and functions of the four pieces of code, namely misx.xml, Modules.xml, News_detect_system.iml and Vcs.xml, were explained to lay the groundwork for the subsequent code operation.
In the db.py code, the functions of some main codes are explained. I think there are still some deficiencies in this piece of code, such as the singleness and reusability of functions, and the failure to handle database connection failures or query errors, which may cause the program to crash or return unfriendly error messages, etc. We have added an error management code for this piece of code. Add an exception handling mechanism to capture possible errors and handle them appropriately, such as logging, returning default values or reconnecting, etc. This enables the program to promptly capture various exceptions that occur during the program's operation, such as database connection errors, network request timeouts, file read and write errors, etc., and take corresponding handling measures based on different types of exceptions to prevent the program from crashing due to exceptions.
In the 3.Main.py code, the functions of some Main codes are explained. Currently, the code can only start one page module. We can extend the support to start multiple page modules simultaneously. By simultaneously starting multiple page modules, the multi-core processor resources of the computer can be fully utilized to achieve parallel processing of different news detection tasks, thereby improving the overall efficiency and performance of the news detection system.<!--by liuqiaolai-->
